## Lab 02

### User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

1. As a developer, I need my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
2. As the creator, I need the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.
3. As a developer, I want wireframes for each of the main views in my portfolio, so I will have a concrete idea of the design I am building.
4. As a developer, I want to make a data model (object constructor) for my portfolio data, so I can store individual projects and render them to the DOM.
5. As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
6. As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.
7. As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.
8. As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device.
9. As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings swiftly.

### User Stories: Stretch Goals

1. As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest material on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.
2. As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on such material to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.


## Lab 03

### User Stories: MVP

1. As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
2. This means your links do NOT navigate to a new page.
3. Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.
4. You can use 'data-' attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab
5. Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.
6. As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.

### Stretch Goals (not required):

1. As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.
2. As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.
3. As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.


## Lab 04

### User Stories: MVP

1. As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.
2. As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.

### User Stories: Stretch Goal

1. As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.
2. Set up your h1, h2, h3 elements according to a type scale(another good type scale article).
3. Include some good fonts, that work well together.
